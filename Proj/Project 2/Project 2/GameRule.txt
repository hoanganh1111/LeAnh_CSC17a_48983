  The computer becomes the codemaker and the user will become
the code breaker. The user will input the size of the sequence 
they want to break as well as the number random from (1-9) for 
each number inside the sequence. The number can be duplicated.
The computer will now randomize all the number and the slots by
the user's choice. The game starts! The user will now given 10 
turns to break the code. They will guess the number of the true
sequence and the computer will tell if how many you got right.
Try using a strategy or you won't be able to solve the sequence. 
If the user ran out of turns or he/she guesses the code right, 
they will rewarded as the true MasterMind.
