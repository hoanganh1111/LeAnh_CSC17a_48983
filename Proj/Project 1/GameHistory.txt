  The game was originated as a board game in the UK. The game 
uses colored coded pegs and only 4 slots. The code maker will
randomly put in the sequence and the code breaker will have 7
turns to solve it. Since it's a 4 pegs with six colors(blue, 
red, white, green, yellow, black) thats a 6^4 = 1296 different
patterns including duplicates. Since this is a modify coded 
created by me, the user will put in the size they want as well
as the random sequence they wish which mean it can have pattern
of n numbers and x sequences random(x^n). If you are truly a 
mastermind, you can figuring out a pattern to solve it using 
eliminate possibilities.
