MASTERMIND CODE BREAKER
The computer becomes the codemaker, the user becomes the code 
breaker. The computer will choose a pattern of 4 code pegs, 
duplicates are allowed. 
The code breaker will try to guess the pattern, in both value
and pattern within 10 turns. After each guess, the codemaker 
will provides feedback about the correction of the turn.
A 'X' peg is placed for each code peg correctedboth color
and position. A 'O' colored peg is placed for each right 
numbered placed in wrong position. Once feedback is provided, 
another guess is made and repeatedly until the guesser run 
out of guesses or he breaks the code.
