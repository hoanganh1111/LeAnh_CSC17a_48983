	The computer becomes the codemaker, the user becomes the code
breaker. The user will input the size of the sequence they want 
to break as well as the number random from 1-9 for each number 
inside the sequence. The number can be duplicated. The user will 
now given 10 turnsto break the code. They will guess the number 
of the sequence and the computer will tell if how many you got 
right. If the use ran out of turn or he/she guess the code right, 
they will rewarded as the true MasterMind.
